# customer-segmentation-using-k-means-clustering
Customer segmentation is one of the key aspects of business-driven companies . Identifying
potential customers is important to know where to put the company's efforts. The majority of
companies run on the ability to retain customers , due to the abundance of products there is a
high chance of risk customers may get confused and couldn't find the product desired.
Customer segmentation focusing on the relationships not only between customers to
customers, but also the interactions between customers and products can achieve highly
promising results in the outcome. In this project deals with propose using the K-means
Clustering algorithm to solve customer segmentation. The algorithm is applied to a dataset,
which is first pre-processed. Data pre-processing is an essential stage in the Data mining
process. Pre-processing the data improves the data quality, thereby improving the outcome of
a data mining task. First the system will apply data integration methods such as normalization
(Min-Max, Z-score) , ensuring that all the dataset attributes are given equal importance. Later
the model will remove redundancies in the dataset using correlation analysis. Now the curated
dataset is ready , which can be used for customer segmentation. This project will use the KMeans
clustering algorithm to segment the data set into K dissimilar clusters depending upon
the similarities of the attributes. Choosing the ‘K’ value in the algorithm plays an important
role in segmenting clusters. In order to choose the optimal value of K, different methods such
as Silhouette or Elbow method. The project aim to show the results after applying the above
mentioned techniques.
